Carrying on from Thulie, it's time to have an open discussion on the goals for building and maintaining the AsyncAPI community. The Community Manager needs to ensure the goals are addressed and that each program/initiative has a dedicated person responsible for it.

Things I think we should focus on in 2025:

- Increase Maintainers
- Onboarding Docs and Video Content
- Community Working Group

Things we should continue investing in:

- Community Initiatives and Programs

## Increase Maintainers
Increasing the number of maintainers in our community remains one of our top goals, and we should continue to explore and experiment with strategies to achieve this. We have three strategies that could contribute significantly to our long-term goal of growing the number of maintainers.

1. **Fully Implement Maintainership** - We are currently in the pilot stages of implementing maintainership and are already seeing positive outcomes. I believe that by 2025, we need to fully integrate this into all our programs. The program will cater to anyone looking to enhance their skills as maintainers and to learn what it takes to become an open-source maintainer. Additionally, we should be open to individuals who want to apply and don't require any stipend.

2. **AsyncAPI Grant Program** - The AsyncAPI Community Grant Program, funded by the AsyncAPI Initiative, aims to provide financial support for critical technical projects and community initiatives within AsyncAPI. This initiative directly contributes to the ongoing goal of growing and retaining maintainers while sustaining the community. The AsyncAPI Grant Program will specifically cater to individual contributors who are part of TSC members and maintainers.

3. **Increase Corpo Involvement** - 


## Onboarding Docs and Video Content
It has become essential to prioritize educational content. These videos can serve as onboarding resources for those looking to understand AsyncAPI and its concepts better. We currently have some training video scripts in the [training repository](https://github.com/asyncapi/training), so we can build on the work we already have.

## Community Working Group Umbrella
I would like to introduce the Community Working Group, which serves as an umbrella for all the community initiatives and programs at AsyncAPI. We have unofficially functioned as a working group, but it's time to increase visibility regarding our current programs and the individuals who help build, lead, and run them.

## Initiatives and Programs
We are still dedicated to growing the following initiatives as they foster our communities, growth, sustainability, and development, and we should continue to invest in them.

### 1. AsyncAPI Conf 2025
I'm pleased with how things went this year and the connections we made through the conference. For 2025, we should hold at least 4 conferences each calendar quarter, including an online edition. Additionally, with some improvements to do:

- Rebrand the name AACoT.
- Revise the conference prospectus.
- Continue the Specs Booth, ensuring it is bigger, better, and properly planned.
- Revamp the current conference website following the rebranding.
- Get conference sponsors and work to convince the AsyncAPI Initiative to become a platinum sponsor.
- Plan conferences outside of Europe (the majority should be outside Europe/Schengen).
- Lastly, we need to start planning as soon as possible!

### 2. AsyncAPI Bounty Program

### 3. Maintainership Program
Revamp our mentorship programs and fully transition to maintainership. Projects participating in 2025 should be structured to promote ownership and prepare contributors to become maintainers-in-training.

Additionally, work on the following:

- Revising the program rules.
- Regularly gathering feedback from mentors and mentees.
- Thoroughly document the learnings from the 2024 maintainership implementations.
- Improving the format for proposal submissions.
- Collaborate with marketing to highlight program success stories, showcase them on our website, and even speak about them at the conference.

Continue participating in open-source grant programs such as GSoC, GSoD, and the AMP (AsyncAPI Maintainership Program).

### 4. AsyncAPI Ambassador Program
Our ambassadors play a significant role in our community, and we have even doubled their numbers. 

For 2025, we need to focus on the following: 

- Revise the Ambassadors' Contribution Guide to include booth volunteering as a requirement. 
-  Gather feedback from the ambassadors on how we can enhance their experience. 
- Involve them in the Education Content initiative.

### 5. Community and Educational Content
Begin developing content based on the training repository and create video materials from it.

### 6. Student Ambassador Program

Get details from Bami

### 7. Working Groups
Assess the current working groups activity and update the YAML file. Expand the requirements to include quarterly reports and roadmap milestones from each working group under AsyncAPI.
